Hey,I'm Dhivya Who is trying to write simple code.

Okay, let's get into the explanation of code.

First for loop prints the numbers of underscores accordingly to the characters of a word

Next for loop runs until the user entered string q(assigned) equals to the original string S(assigned).

Also the Inner for loop runs each and every time until the outer for loop condition get failed

We can also skip this inner for loop With the simple step System.out.println(q)

For user-friendliness, I have placed this inner for loop in my code

Time complexity with inner for loop:O(n2) Time complexity without inner for loop:O(n)
